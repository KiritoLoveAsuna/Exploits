# CVE-2022-27254
PoC for vulnerability in Honda's Remote Keyless System(CVE-2022-27254)

 ## Summary:
 
This is a proof of concept for [CVE-2022-27254](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27254), wherein the remote keyless system on various Honda vehicles send the same, unencrypted RF signal for each door-open, door-close, boot-open and remote start(if applicable). This allows for an attacker to eavesdrop on the request and conduct a replay attack.

## Vehicles Affected:

• 2016-2020 Honda Civic(LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, Si, Type R)

## Important Notes:
 
     •Key fob FCC ID: KR5V2X

     •Key fob frequency: 433.215MHz

     •Key fob modulation: FSK


## Tools used: 
           
           •FCCID.io
           •HackRF One
           •Gqrx
           •GNURadio



## Prevention:
  - Manufacturers:
    1. Manufacturers must implement Rolling Codes, otherwise known as hopping code. It is a security technology commonly used to provide a fresh code for each authentication of a remote keyless entry (RKE) or passive keyless entry (PKE) system.


  - Consumers:
    1. Utilize a Faraday Pouch for the key fob.
    1. Use the PKE as opposed to the RKE, this would make it significantly harder for an attacker to clone/read the signal due to the proximity they would need to be at to do so.
 
⚠️ The precautions mentioned above ARE NOT foolproof ⚠️

If you believe that you are a victim of this attack, the only current mitigation is to reset your key fob at the dealership.
